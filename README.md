diabetes dataset https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database This data frame contains following columns:
 1.Pregnancies: This column typically represents the number of times a person has been pregnant. It's a numeric (integer) attribute.

2.Glucose: This column represents the glucose concentration in the blood, often measured in milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL). It's a numeric (continuous) attribute and is an important indicator in diabetes diagnosis.

3.BloodPressure: This column represents the blood pressure of the individual. It's also a numeric (continuous) attribute and is typically measured in millimeters of mercury (mm Hg).

4.SkinThickness: This column represents the thickness of the skinfold at a certain location on the body. It's another numeric (continuous) attribute, which might be used in body composition measurements.

5.Insulin: This column represents the insulin level in the blood, typically measured in microunits per milliliter (ÂµU/mL). It's a numeric (continuous) attribute and is related to glucose metabolism.

6.BMI (Body Mass Index): BMI is a measure of body fat based on an individual's weight in relation to their height. It's a numeric (continuous) attribute, and it's calculated as weight in kilograms divided by the square of height in meters.

7.DiabetesPedigreeFunction: This column is a numeric (continuous) attribute that represents a function designed to measure the likelihood of diabetes based on family hitory. It often accounts for the genetic component of diabetes risk.

8.Age: Age is a numeric (integer) attribute that represents the age of the individual.

9.Outcome: This column is a binary (categorical) attribute that typically represents the target variable or the label in a diabetes prediction task. It often takes two values, such as 0 for "No Diabetes" and 1 for "Diabetes," indicating the presence or absence of diabetes in the individual.
